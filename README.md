## Treehouse Project 10 - Full Stack App with React and a REST API

React app for existing school database REST API. This full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, users are able to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.
